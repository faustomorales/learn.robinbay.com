        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">What Are Variables?</h1>
        <p class="mb-2">
            In programming, a variable is like a container that holds
            information. You can name the container and store something inside
            it, like a number or a word. When you need that information later,
            you can use the variableâ€™s name to get it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of a variable like a sticky note. You can write something on
            it, stick it somewhere, and look at it when you need to remember
            what you wrote.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 mt-2">Example</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
            Here is an example of a variable in JavaScript. This code creates a
            variable called message and stores the word "Hello!" inside it.
            Hover over each part of the code to see what it does.
