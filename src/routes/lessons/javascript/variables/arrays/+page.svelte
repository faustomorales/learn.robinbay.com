    {#snippet explanation()}
        <p class="mb-2">
            In programming, an array is a special type of variable that can
            store multiple values instead of just one. Think of it like a list
            or a row of boxes, where each box holds a piece of data. Arrays are
            useful when we need to keep track of many things at once, like a
            list of names, numbers, or colors.
        </p>

    {#snippet example()}
        Hereâ€™s an example of an array in JavaScript. This code contains a series
        of strings that could refer to people's names.

        <AnnotatedCode
            code={`var names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Sally"];`}
            language="js"
        />

        This array contains three names. Each color is written inside
        <span class="font-bold">quotation marks</span>
        (since they are strings, just as you learned in Lesson 1), and they are separated
        by
        <span class="font-bold">commas</span>
        inside <span class="font-bold">square brackets</span>. All arrays use
        this structure, no matter what type of data they store.
    {/snippet}

    {#snippet task()}
        <p class="mb-2">
            In Lesson 1, we made the ball light up with one color. In this
            lesson, you can provide an <CodeText>array</CodeText> of colors through
            which the ball will cycle. Write JavaScript code to create an array named
            <CodeText>colors</CodeText> that contains at least three different colors
            of your choice. See
