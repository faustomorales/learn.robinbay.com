    {#snippet explanation()}
        <p class="mb-2">
            In programming, a variable is like a container that holds
            information. You can name the container and store something inside
            it, like a number or a word. When you need that information later,
            you can use the variableâ€™s name to get it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of a variable like a sticky note. You can write something on
            it, stick it somewhere, and look at it when you need to remember
            what you wrote.
